<p>You can build "easy" on top of "simple", but it's hard to do the reverse.<br>

Biff speeds up web development by providing as much functionality as possible
out-of-the-box while making it easy to swap out, modify, or remove parts as
your project grows. It prioritizes small-to-medium sized projects.

The goal is to provide the benefits of a web framework without sacrificing the
simplicity that makes Clojure great.

## About

Biff is developed by myself, [Jacob O'Bryant](https://tfos.co). I use it for all my web apps, primarily
[Yakread](https://yakread.com/) and [The Sample](https://thesample.ai/), each of which has
15k-20k lines of code. See r/Clojure for
[comments about Biff](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/search/?q=biff&restrict_sr=1&type=comment).

Biff is generously sponsored by [JUXT](https://www.juxt.pro/) and
[other individuals](https://github.com/sponsors/jacobobryant/), and it has received
multiple grants from [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/).
